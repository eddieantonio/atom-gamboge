# UNMAINTAINED

Gamboge was a term project, but as a full-time student with a job I do
not have time to maintain it or upgrade it to Atom API 1.0.

If you're reading this, you should totally apply natural language
processing to code, and not just for code suggestion!

It's like SwiftKey, but for code. In prototyping stages.
